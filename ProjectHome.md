“Smash It” is a 2D Jump and Run Game that may be used by everybody who has an interest in playing games. It’s a short game that can be played during small breaks to stimulate the mood of the player in a positive way.
The game offers different play modes. It can be chosen between a two-player game up to a four player game in non-network mode. That means the game can be played by max four players on one PC. By choosing the network mode the number of players can be increased up to 8 Players.
Every player has to navigate his character through the 2D-Landscape by jumping and/or moving him to the left or the right. Each players target is to jump onto each other’s character.  The player who gets jumped on loses a life point. If the player lost all his life points he has to leave the game. The player who lasts the longest is the winner.
To keep the game exciting there is the possibility to create own 2D-landscapes with the level-editor.
